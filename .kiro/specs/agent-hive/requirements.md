# Requirements Document

## Introduction

AgentHive is a unified multi-agent system that provides both direct interaction with specialized AI agents and autonomous task delegation to a coordinated team of agents. Built on LangGraph, the system operates in two distinct modes: Direct Interaction Mode for chatting with individual specialist agents, and Autonomous Orchestration Mode for delegating complex tasks to an intelligent orchestrator that manages the entire agent team. The system supports multiple AI models (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) and integrates with both web interfaces and Slack for seamless user interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact directly with specialized agents, so that I can get expert assistance for specific domains without involving the entire team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects direct interaction mode THEN the system SHALL present a list of available specialized agents
2. WHEN a user chooses a specific agent THEN the system SHALL establish a direct chat session with only that agent
3. WHEN a user sends a message to a specific agent THEN the system SHALL route the message only to that agent and return its response
4. IF a user requests an unavailable agent THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating the agent is not found
5. WHEN a direct chat session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context within that session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delegate complex tasks to an autonomous orchestrator, so that multiple specialized agents can collaborate to complete comprehensive projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects autonomous orchestration mode THEN the system SHALL accept high-level task descriptions
2. WHEN a complex task is submitted THEN the orchestrator SHALL analyze the task and determine which agents are needed
3. WHEN the orchestrator processes a task THEN it SHALL coordinate between multiple agents based on task requirements
4. WHEN agents collaborate on a task THEN the system SHALL maintain shared state and context across all participating agents
5. WHEN a task is completed THEN the orchestrator SHALL provide a comprehensive summary of the work performed by all agents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to support multiple AI models, so that I can choose the best model for each agent's specialized function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring an agent THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini models
2. WHEN an agent is created THEN the system SHALL allow model selection independently for each agent
3. WHEN switching between models THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent agent behavior and capabilities
4. IF a selected model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or error handling
5. WHEN using different models THEN the system SHALL normalize responses to maintain consistent state structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to access AgentHive through Slack, so that I can use the system within my existing workflow without switching applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message in Slack THEN the system SHALL detect whether it's a direct agent request or orchestration task
2. WHEN using Slack integration THEN the system SHALL support both interaction modes through slash commands or mentions
3. WHEN an agent responds in Slack THEN the system SHALL format responses appropriately for the Slack interface
4. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain separate conversation contexts
5. WHEN a task is completed in Slack THEN the system SHALL provide threaded responses to maintain conversation flow

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access AgentHive through a modern web interface, so that I can have a rich interactive experience with visual mode switching and enhanced features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear UI elements to switch between direct and orchestration modes
2. WHEN in direct mode THEN the web interface SHALL display available agents with descriptions and capabilities
3. WHEN in orchestration mode THEN the web interface SHALL provide a task submission form with guidance
4. WHEN agents are processing requests THEN the web interface SHALL show real-time status updates and progress indicators
5. WHEN conversations are active THEN the web interface SHALL maintain chat history and allow conversation export

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to be built on an extensible LangGraph foundation, so that new specialized agents can be easily added without modifying core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new agent THEN the system SHALL require only agent-specific configuration without core system changes
2. WHEN a new agent is added THEN it SHALL automatically be available in both direct and orchestration modes
3. WHEN agents are defined THEN they SHALL use a consistent interface that works with the shared state system
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL dynamically discover and load all available agent configurations
5. WHEN agents are updated THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading without requiring full system restart

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain stateful conversations and task context, so that agents can build upon previous interactions and collaborate effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation begins THEN the system SHALL initialize a shared state object with task, messages, routing, and scratchpad data
2. WHEN agents process messages THEN they SHALL update the shared state with their contributions and findings
3. WHEN multiple agents collaborate THEN the system SHALL ensure state consistency across all agent interactions
4. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL persist conversation state for potential continuation
5. WHEN state conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL implement resolution strategies to maintain data integrity

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to share multimodal content including images, PDFs, and design documents, so that agents can analyze visual information and provide comprehensive assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL process and analyze the visual content using vision-capable models
2. WHEN a user shares a PDF document THEN the system SHALL extract and process the text content for agent analysis
3. WHEN design documents are uploaded THEN specialized agents SHALL be able to interpret layouts, wireframes, and visual specifications
4. WHEN multimodal content is shared in orchestration mode THEN all relevant agents SHALL have access to the processed content
5. WHEN processing multimodal content THEN the system SHALL maintain content context throughout the conversation
6. IF unsupported file types are uploaded THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with supported format guidance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the system to be deployable anywhere, so that it can run in various environments including cloud platforms, on-premises servers, and development machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL support containerized deployment with Docker
2. WHEN configuring deployment THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all external dependencies
3. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt to available resources
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of agent processing
5. WHEN monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and metrics endpoints
